          Since entering the L.A. and Bay Area tech scenes in 2011, our founders have started two companies together and met hundreds of senior-level developers, especially in Argentina. Unfortunately, we also met startup friends in the U.S. who were constantly struggling to recruit, screen, manage and retain good developers, and many ended up hiring inexperienced workers or overpriced agencies. We built Otter to help solve this problem.
